------------------ Brain_*.gs: Functional Brain Network Analysis Data (Brain) -------------------
(from https://github.com/shiruipan/graph_datasets )
**Description:**

BrainNet Functional Brain Network Analysis Data are constructed from the whole brain functional magnetic res- onance image (fMRI) atlas [6]. The purpose of the study is to map brain as a network (or a graph) where each node corresponds to a region of Interest (ROI) and the edge indicates correlations between two ROIs. In our experiments, we use functional parcellation results, CC200, from [6], which parcellate each brain into 200 regions of interest. In order to discover relationships between ROIs, the mean values of each ROI are recorded with respect to certain voxel time courses. By using Pearson correlations between two time courses, we can calculate correlation between two ROIs, and a graph is constructed by connecting ROIs whose correlations is higher than a threshold value. For ADHD and HI tasks, the functional response is real values, so we discretize the functional response to binary values by using a simple threshold.

------------------ DBLP_v1.gs: DBLP Graph Datasets (DBLP) -------------------------
(from https://github.com/shiruipan/graph_datasets )
**Description:**

The DBLP dataset consists of bibliography data in computer science. Each record in DBLP is associated with a number of attributes such as abstract, authors, year, venue, title, and reference ID. To build a graph stream, we select a list of conferences (as shown in Table I) and use the papers published in these conferences (in chronological order) to form a binary-class graph stream. The classification task is to predict whether a paper belongs to DBDM (database and data mining) or CVPR (computer vision and pattern recognition) field, by using the references and the title of each paper. 

Number of Datasets: **1**


**Version 1:**
Each paper in DBLP is represented as a graph, where each node denotes a Paper ID or a keyword and each edge denotes the citation relationship between papers or keyword relations in the title. More specifically, we denote that (1) each paper ID is a node; (2) if a paper P.A cites another paper P.B, there is an edge between P.A and P.B; (3) each keyword in the title is also a node; (4) each paper ID node is connected to the keyword nodes of the paper; and (5) for each paper, its keyword nodes are fully connected with each other. An example of DBLP graph data is shown in Fig. 4.

---------------- learn_*.gs --------------------------------------
These are DBLPs extracted from our malware I assume?

---------------- mutagen*.gs -------------------------------------
(from https://github.com/axot/GLP )

Not sure where these come from but I read something about mutagen benchmarks being very standard, it's probably one of those. I will investigate if we use it.

---------------- NIC_*.gs: NCI Anti-cancer activity prediction data (NCI)----
(from https://github.com/shiruipan/graph_datasets )

**Description:** 

The NCI graph datasets are commonly used as the benchmark for graph classification. Each NCI dataset belongs to a bioassay task for anticancer activity prediction, where each chemical compound is represented as a graph, with atoms representing nodes and bonds as edges. A chemical compound is positive if it is active against the corresponding cancer, or negative otherwise.  Table 1 summarizes the NCI graph data we download from PubChem. We have removed disconnected graphs and graphs with unexpected atoms (some graphs have atoms represented as `*`) in the original graphs. Columns 2-3 show the number of positive and total number of graphs in each dataset, and Columns 4-5 indicate the average number of nodes and edges in each dataset, respectively. 

Number of Datasets: **18 (9 imbalanced + 9 balanced data)**
 
**Full Dataset:**

The full datasets of NCI graphs can be downloaded here (**[NCI_full.zip](https://github.com/shiruipan/graph_datasets/blob/master/Graph_Repository/NCI_full.zip?raw=true)**), which are naturally imbalanced and ideal benchmark for imbalanced or cost-sensitive graph classification. We have considered cost-sensitive graph classification in [2], and graph stream classification in [3][4][5].

**Partial Dataset:**

We randomly select #Pos number of negative graphs from each original graph set to create balanced graph datasets, which are available here (**[NCI_balanced.zip](https://github.com/shiruipan/graph_datasets/blob/master/Graph_Repository/NCI_balanced.zip?raw=true)**). This dataset was used in [7] for genral graph classification and [5] for multi-task graph classification

-------------- TWITTER-Real-Graph-Partial.gs: Twitter Sentiment Graph Data (Twitter)
(from https://github.com/shiruipan/graph_datasets )
**Description:**

This dataset is extracted from twitter sentiment classification. Because of the inherently short and sparse nature, twitter sentiment analysis (i.e., predicting whether a tweet reflects a positive or a negative feeling) is a difficult task. To build a graph dataset, we represent each tweet as a graph by using tweet content, with nodes in each graph denoting the terms and/or smiley symbols (e.g, :-D and :-P) and edges indicating the co-occurrence relationship between two words or symbols in each tweet. To ensure the quality of the graph, we only use tweets containing 20 or more words. We select the tweets from April 6 to June 16 to generate 140,949 graphs (in a chronological order). This dataset has been used for graph stream classification in [3] and cost-sensitive learning in [2].
